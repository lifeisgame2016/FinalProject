        <h3> Number of Fibonacci </h3>

        <div class="subscribe">
            <div>
                <input type="text" id="field1" name="filedFib" placeholder="please, enter a positive integer">

        <p> Fibonacci numbers is a numerical sequence, in which first two elements are equal to 1,
            and each remaining number is equal to the sum of the previous two:
            F(1) = F(2) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).
            (Note that this is different than the traditional definition of the Fibonacci function,
            where F(0) = F(1) = 1, but it doesn’t really matter, as the output is the same.)
            The task is to output first 16 Fibonacci numbers in the following format:
            1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, …
        </p>

        <p>   Note that this example can be implemented in several ways:

            <li>using the recurrence equation itself.
                The least efficient way which illustrates the usage of recurrent functions.</li>
            <li>saving calculated numbers in an array. Illustrates the usage of arrays.</li>
            <li>using Binet’s formula. Illustrates the usage of math functions.</li>

        <h3> Factorial </h3>

        <div class="subscribe">
            <div>
                <input type="text" id="field2" name="filedFact" placeholder="please, enter a positive integer">

        </div>

        <p> In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!,
            is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,
        </p>
        <h4> 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120</h4>
        <p>
            The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.
        </p>
        <p>
            The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics,
            notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis.
            Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways
            to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects).
            This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.
            Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.
            After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial
            (using the language of the original):
        </p>
        <p>
            Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number
            comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers,
            ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed
            by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;
        </p>
        <p>
            The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments,
            while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics,
            notably techniques from mathematical analysis.
